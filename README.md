Tableau Homework:

Leveraging 2018 Data, I have created two dashboards for CitiBike data. The first outlines demographics of riders, as provided in the data. The user can toggle based on month to change all charts to desired month or entire range. 

The second dashboard shows geographically the most popular starting point and end point. 

The first dashboard can be leveraged by marketing members of CitiBike. Are there specific age or gender groups to promote to that are underrepresented? The actual age of the drivers appears to have errors in false reporting. There is a high number of individuals that are 49 years old, beyond what would be reasonable for the data set. It is also doubtful that individuals 112 years old are riding the B Cycle. 

The most obvious use of a popularity dashboard is to ensure that supply is kept up at popular stops. If bikes run out there is a loss potential in revenue.
